Hello World for Google Glass
============================

 This is the basic Android project for side-loading onto Glass.
 It enables a voice trigger "hello world" and shows a textview when started.

 The voice trigger can be set in res/values/string.xml (it's the voice_trigger) which is referenced in the xml/voicecmd.xml file.
